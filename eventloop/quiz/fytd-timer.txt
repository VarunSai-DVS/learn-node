- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

foo
baz
foo
baz
2 : bar
1 : bar

The async call will wait and other calls are completed first, then after both foo and baz
complete these 'bar' are executed.

Timeout is 0 the timeouts are moved from timers to pending callbacks immediately, after the
sync calls complete then the pending callbacks are executed.
