- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.

1. setTimeout is put into timers queue of event loop.
2. Callback passed to someAsyncFunction is executed.
3. After the file read completed, it goes to poll and then moved to pending callbacks this one gets
   priority since it has I/O.

- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s?
 Why or why not?

1. Order doesn't change since the callbacks movement from timers to pending_callbacks is delayed.

- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

1. If we decrease to 0, the order changes, since the call moves to pending_callbacks queue even before the other callback.
