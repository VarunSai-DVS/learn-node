- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.

Error
I was scheduled to run immediately
1ms have passed since I was scheduled

1. The I/O operation is performed.
2. The callback function is pushed to the Queue and executed since it is the only one.
3. Inside the callback function two new callbacks are invoked, which are the timeout and the check.
4. After the check call back has been executed, the timer callback is executed.

- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
No change as the check callback takes priority over timer callback.
